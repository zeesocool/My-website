    <p>I don't really watch romance films but I really enjoy this one. This soundtrack is amazing. The performances were outstanding by all the actors and actresses. My favorite part about the whole movie is the narration and the way they decide to present with the vintage camera.The plot is very simple but it is still interesting. </p>

  <p>I really love the main character. He can be relatable to me because I'm introverted and I was very shy in high school as well. And like Charlie, my friends have been a safe space for me. The soundtrack is also really good. I also love the narration in the movie.</p>

    <h3>Stand By Me</h3>
    <p>This movie is very special to me. I love Stephen King movies. It was funny, it was sad, and happy all throughout the movie, just like life. It was very enjoyable to me. I wish I could be a 12-year-old boy sometimes. I feel like society makes girls grow up too soon.</p>

    <h4>Dead Poets Society</h4>
    <p>I love this movie so much. I just love movies about friendships so much, especially healthy male friendships. I find that society tends to bring down healthy male friendships by telling them that boys can’t compliment another boy because it's “gay” or “feminine”. I found this movie did a great job of portraying healthy male friendships and just youths in general. I love the over all message.</p>
