                   <h5>Dead poets society<h5>
                        <p> Dead poets society is one of my all-time favourite movies. It takes place in 1959, it is about a    literature teacher at an all-boys boarding school, who encourages this students to live to the fullest and break free from what society wants from you. So, 7 of his students (Tod, Neil, Knox, Charlie, Meeks, Pitts and Cameron) decided to reopen this secret society called the dead poets society.  In which they sneak out at night to a cave to read poetry to each other by doing so forming a close bond to each other. However, nothing good lasts for ever.<p>
